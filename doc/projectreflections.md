#Project Reflections

###Amanda:  
Working on this project gave me the opportunity to use many software tools that previously I had little to no experience with.
This was the first time in a few years that I had written anything in Python and certainly has been my largest project using this language. I had only used GitHub for one class project before, and never really relied on Git or the command line for project editing and version control. I had only heard about Django before this semester, and had just a vague idea of its uses. Testing with Selenium and database use were both completely new for me. I feel much more comfortable with Git, GitHub, command line, and Selenium. I feel like I still need a lot of practice with Python, Django, and databases to be proficient. Overall, I would say that this has been a great introduction to some technology and practices that I want to continue to pursue.

I feel good about this project. I am proud of what I was able to accomplish given the limited knowledge I went in with, and the time constraints I had this semester. Even though learning Django has been a challenge, I really enjoyed working with it along with Python and Selenium. I plan to use them again in the future.  

I do have a few regrets about this project. I wish I had been able to devote more time to it, because I feel like I could have learned more and created more functionality. If we had decided on a direction for the project sooner, we may have had more time to work on development. I wish I hadn't included the "'s" in our GitHub project team name, I mistyped it so many times in Git!  

As far as Pro-Vax is concerned, I doubt that I will do more with the project. But I am determined to use Python and Django again to work on a personal project this summer.  

The only thing that I feel made this project difficult to work on was the time constraints that our team faced. All three of us have jobs in addition to our classes. That sometimes made it difficult to schedule meetings and communicate in real time. Looking back, it probably would have been helpful to set a scheduled meeting once a week for discussion.
