  ## Retro
  
 
  
  ### Good
  
  * We all agree on the direction of the project
  * Each one of us has been working equally on the project
  
  ### Bad
  
  * We have not communicated very well at times
  * We each had issues getting Django and the virtual environment working on our machines
  
  ### Actionable Commitments
  
  * As a team, we have agreed to communicate more
  * We will ask each other for help when needed
