# Pro-Vax Project Proposal

The intention of this project is to develop a web app that can be used by the public to find their eligibility for a Covid-19 vaccination and the closest available vaccination center. Future features may include symptom trackers and notifications regarding mutant strains and virus surges in the user's area.

Information regarding Covid-19 vaccination availability is constantly changing and it can be difficult for the average citizen to find out when and where they may be able to receive a vaccine without searching through many different online sources. If you are not over the age of 70 or a healthcare worker, you may have no idea where your place in line might be at any given time. With new vaccines being developed and guidelines constantly updating, this information is likely to change at a faster rate in the near future. In order to easily stay abreast of this information, users can visit one site: Pro-Vax. Users will be able to input their pertinent details such as age, location, and any health conditions on the Pro-Vax web app. The app will then provide a personalized run-down of when the vaccine will be available to that user, where they will be able to receive it, and which vaccine will likely be given. If a user signs up for notifications, they can enter their information one time and be notified via email when it is their turn in line.

## Vision Statement
FOR members of the public WHO need to find information about their own eligibility for a Covid-19 vaccination, local availability and provider sites. THE Pro-Vax web app allows users to have access to the latest up-to-date information available so that they may better protect themselves.
UNLIKE individual healthcare provider or state government controlled web sites, OUR product provides real-time aggregate information from the CDC and multiple states so that the user can decide on the best course of action for their health and safety.

Adults under the age of 70 who are unsure of their place in the vaccination queue are the target users for the Pro-Vax web app. 

## Implementation
The Pro-Vax web app will be developed using Python with Django framework, which uses the SQLite database.
